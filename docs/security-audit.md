# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the security assessment of the Todo Application infrastructure and codebase.

## Scope
- Application Code
- Infrastructure Configuration
- Network Security
- Authentication & Authorization
- Data Protection

## Findings

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
**Severity: High**
- Current implementation uses basic authentication
- No rate limiting implemented
- No password complexity requirements

**Recommendations:**
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Add rate limiting
- Enforce password complexity rules

### 2. Network Security
**Severity: Medium**
- Basic Docker network isolation
- No TLS/SSL implementation
- Exposed ports need review

**Recommendations:**
- Implement TLS/SSL
- Review and minimize exposed ports
- Add network policies

### 3. Data Protection
**Severity: High**
- Sensitive data in environment variables
- No encryption at rest
- No data backup strategy

**Recommendations:**
- Implement secrets management
- Add data encryption
- Create backup strategy

### 4. Infrastructure Security
**Severity: Medium**
- Basic container security
- No resource limits
- No security scanning

**Recommendations:**
- Implement container security best practices
- Add resource limits
- Regular security scanning

## Action Items
1. [ ] Implement JWT authentication
2. [ ] Add rate limiting
3. [ ] Configure TLS/SSL
4. [ ] Implement secrets management
5. [ ] Set up regular security scanning
6. [ ] Create backup strategy

## Timeline
- Immediate Actions (1-2 weeks)
- Short-term Improvements (1 month)
- Long-term Security Enhancements (3 months)

## Conclusion
The application requires several security improvements to meet industry standards. Priority should be given to authentication and data protection measures.
